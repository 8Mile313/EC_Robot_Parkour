This paper studies the morphology and behavior of evolving populations
of modular robots that are able to move in a pre-defined trail
placed with different obstacles. Also, this paper explores the possibility
and impact of transferring populations of modular robots from
a simple environment to a complex one. To assess these properties,
we defined four different types of terrain, designed a particular fitness
function, and evolved generations of modular robots on them.
The result shows that transferring modular robots from an easier
terrain to a complex one impacts the robots both morphologically
and behaviorally. The result also shows that transferring robots
from easier terrain to a complex one has the potential capability to
evolve more well-optimized individuals than native complex robots.
